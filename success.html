			  <p>Availability studies are a research method that involves replicating the steps that library users take to go from a citation to full text (or an error). They use a sample to approximate the proportion of your entire library collection that is available in full text or generates an error. </p>

			  <aside class="notes">
			  <p>Availability studies are a systems analysis research method, measuring the performance of the library as a “system” able to deliver full text information. Different researchers have defined the system in slightly different ways. In my research study, I identified six discrete parts. Each of them has to work together for users to get to full text, and each of them is a potential point of failure. </p>
