			  <aside class="notes">
			  <p>Availability studies are a research method that involves replicating the steps that library users take to go from a citation to full text (or an error). They use a sample to approximate the proportion of your entire library collection that is available in full text or generates an error. </p>

			  <aside class="notes">
			  <p>Availability studies are a systems analysis research method, measuring the performance of the library as a “system” able to deliver full text information. Different researchers have defined the system in slightly different ways. In my research study, I identified six discrete parts. Each of them has to work together for users to get to full text, and each of them is a potential point of failure. </p>

			  <h2>Example</h2>
			  <p><img data-src="img/availability-example.png" alt="Example of an ILLIAD error" /></p>
			  <aside class="notes">
			  <p>This example illustrates the kind of problems I hope to find and correct through availability research. Source database contributed metadata from a book chapter into an ILLIAD article request form; a unicode error occurred, and an invalid date was provided. This request cannot be filled automatically via Direct Request, and may require significant intervention from a librarian or ILL staff before it can be placed at all. These kinds of problems cost time (and money) to troubleshoot and can be very frustrating for library users and staff alike. My availability research seeks to answer three questions: why do problems like this occur, how often do they happen, and what can we do as librarians to stop these problems from happening again? </p>
