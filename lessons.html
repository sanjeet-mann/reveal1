			      <p>This is the archived version of a presentation I gave at Loyola Marymount University on March 2, 2023, as part of a panel titled “DEI Collections Audits: How We Did It, and How We Wished We Had.” See the <a href="https://scelcapalooza2023.sched.com/event/1FZu8/speaker-panel-dei-collections-audits-how-we-did-it-and-how-we-wished-we-had​" target="_blank">conference program</a> for more information.</p>
			      <p>I’m reporting on a collection diversity audit conducted at Armacost Library, University of Redlands, in Fall 2020. University of Redlands is a comprehensive liberal arts university with nearly 4,000 campus FTE.​ It comprises an undergraduate liberal arts college and schools of Business, Education and Theology (thanks to a recent merger). ​It is located on ancestral lands of Cahuilla, Coast Miwok, and Serrano nations in present-day Redlands and Marin. ​While historically a Predominantly White Institution, student demographics have changed and the campus is now a proud Hispanic Serving Institution thanks to hard work by a campus taskforce.</p>

			    <aside class="notes">
			      <p>After George Floyd was murdered in the summer of 2020, Armacost Librarians drafted a <a href="https://armacostlibrary.blogspot.com/2020/06/systemic-racism-and-anti-black-police.html" target="_blank">statement</a> on systemic racism and anti-Black police violence for the library blog. We wanted to understand how well our collection supported intersectional teaching and scholarship about race, gender and sexual orientation. My colleagues Tiffany Chai, Lua Gregory and I agreed to undertake a collection audit modeled after Scott Stone’s audit of theater playscripts at UC Irvine. ​

			      <p><img data-src="img/approaches_collection_assessment.png" alt="Peggy Johnson's diagram of four approaches to collection assessment" /></p>
			      <aside class="notes">
				<p>Peggy Johnson’s textbook Fundamentals of Collection Assessment describes four common ways to assess a library collection. ​You can use quantitative or qualitative methods and focus on library users or on the collection itself. ​Counting books assigned to particular LCSH or LCCN, or measuring author demographics, are all examples of quantitative, collection focused methods.​ Reading lists, award lists or other checklists are an example of qualitative, collection focused methods. ​User-centered alternatives could include looking at circ and ILL statistics for books related to antiracism. ​Or we could conduct focus groups with faculty and students who teach and research on racism to learn about their experiences using the library to find information. ​Other librarians who have done collection audits emphasize the importance of using multiple methods. ​

			    <h2>How we assessed the collection</h2>
    			    <ul>
			      <li>1,569 authors of books purchased FY1920</li>
			      <li>1,171 books listed on 8 popular reading lists</li>
			    </ul>
			    <aside class="notes">
			      <p> We conducted a two-part study. We looked at [self-reported] race, gender and sexual orientation of authors of books we purchased the previous fiscal year.​ We checked 8 popular reading lists about racism and Black history and culture. ​We trained student workers to conduct the audit; the work was done over five months from August to December 2020 while our campus was still physically closed, and everyone was working remotely. ​

			    <aside class="notes">
			      <p> Out of a total of 1,569 authors, we found pluralities of straight, White and male authors. ​A significant number of authors could not be identified despite the best efforts of our student workers.​

			    <aside class="notes">
			      <p>As I was preparing to be on this panel, I was curious to see how our findings compared with other demographic audits. ​It’s difficult to compare results across libraries because of differences in the sample that was chosen, which author attributes were studied, and how results were reported. ​At least three other studies that have analyzed author demographics by race have also found large numbers of White authors and many unidentified authors.

			      <p>We held 53% of 1,171 books across the eight lists. ​The lowest holding was 35% for the Schomberg Center YA list (included because we have a juv collection)​ The highest holding was 88% for the bibliography put out by Racism Review (a scholarly journal)​</p>

			      <p>This appears to put us in the middle of other institutions that have published their checklist audits recently. ​Penn State had 904 titles from the Lambda and Stonewall LGBTQ awards lists.​ Oregon State had 2,408 titles from 22 awards lists.​ University of Kansas expanded on that study to 6,671 titles from 57 awards lists. ​</p>

			      <aside class="notes">
				<p>Collection diversity audits are a concrete way to understand how inequities in society, in scholarly communication, and in the publishing world impact our work in libraries. ​The quote illustrates how this work is a mindset that is practiced over time, not a one-off project with a clear end point. ​My colleagues and I developed some next steps as we completed our audit, but our implementation met with mixed results…​</p>

			      <h2>Challenges</h2>
			       <p>
				 <ul>
				   <li>Share findings with campus and colleagues <span style="color:yellow;" class="fragment">PARTIALLY DONE</span></li>
				   <li>Purchase missing titles <span style="color:yellow" class="fragment">MOSTLY DONE</span></li>
				   <li>Adjust demand driven acquisition (DDA) parameters <span style="color:green" class="fragment">DONE</span></li>
				   <li>Set goals for collecting titles by authors of color <span style="color:red" class="fragment">NOT DONE</span></li>
				 </ul>
			       </p>
			       <aside class="notes">
				 <p>We’ve presented our work as a virtual poster at ALA, and now here, but we didn’t share our findings with the campus community. Individual selectors have prioritized buying the work of authors of color, queer authors, and transgender people. We’ve adjusted our DDA parameters to “blacklist” some oligopolistic publishers. We are trying to seek out small and independent presses that publish work by people of color and buy from independent and Black owned bookstores when possible. However, we have not set any targets or done a follow up study, so we don’t know if, or how much, our purchasing demographics actually changed.</p>

			      <blockquote>"Cost saving strategies ... have largely favored vendor relationships over investing in collective effort among librarians and are part and parcel of a larger dynamic of business logic within higher education that privileges demand and immediate need over long-term support for scholarship and equity."</blockquote>
			      <p style="text-align:right;">Jahnke, Tanaka and Palazzolo 2022, p. 179</p>
			      <aside class="notes">
				<p>In the three years after this study, Armacost Library experienced significant staffing turnover and collections budget cuts. Our librarian FTE dropped from 7 to 4 and the library leader, and two of the interim leaders who replaced her, all left. Many of you in the room can share similar experiences. ​This is a problem because an environment of resource constraints encourages libraries to maximize efficiencies – relying on approval plans and vendor purchasing platforms – and to forgo the careful research needed to seek out alternatives to an inequitable publishing and purchasing ecosystem. The quote here (from an article on structural barriers to collection diversity published in last March’s College & Research Libraries) is provocative, and I think it gives us all something worth reflecting on as we try to draw lessons from these collection audits. ​</p>
