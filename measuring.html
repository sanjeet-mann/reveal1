			  <li>ILLIAD interlibrary loan system</li>
			  <li>Full text targets (databases, ejournals): 79,757 unique titles</li>

			  <aside class="notes">
			  <p>This diagram presents an overview of Armacost Library’s e-resource discovery infrastructure. Five systems (proxy server, source database, knowledge base/link resolver, target database and ILL system) must work together using common standards for students and faculty to be able to discover full text.​</p>

			  <h2>Why do electronic resource errors matter?</h2>
			  <p><ul>
			  <li>Costs</li>
			  <li>Frustrated expectations</li>
			  <li>Undermined confidence</li>
			  <li>Complicated instruction</li>
			  </ul></p>
			  <aside class="notes">
			  <p>Electronic resource errors cost libraries in terms of unrealized value on paid-for content that cannot be accessed, and in terms of staff time spent on troubleshooting. Unnecessary ILL requests also add staff costs and IFM/copyright charges.​ Errors frustrate student and faculty expectations and undermine library staff confidence in the accuracy of their own systems for day-to-day use. Scarce physical and fiscal resources are already compelling libraries to justify their relevance to their campuses; unavailable e-resources only fuel skeptics’ concerns. ​Errors also require instruction librarians to take precious course time away from higher-order thinking skills to explain technical workarounds and search mechanics in greater detail. ​</p>

			      <p> Out of a total of 1,569 authors, we found pluralities of straight, White and male authors. ​A significant number of authors could not be identified despite the best efforts of our student workers.​

			    <aside class="notes">
			      <p>As I was preparing to be on this panel, I was curious to see how our findings compared with other demographic audits. ​It’s difficult to compare results across libraries because of differences in the sample that was chosen, which author attributes were studied, and how results were reported. ​At least three other studies that have analyzed author demographics by race have also found large numbers of White authors and many unidentified authors.

			    <aside class="notes">
			      <p>We held 53% of 1,171 books across the eight lists. ​The lowest holding was 35% for the Schomberg Center YA list (included because we have a juv collection)​ The highest holding was 88% for the bibliography put out by Racism Review (a scholarly journal)​</p>

			      <p>This appears to put us in the middle of other institutions that have published their checklist audits recently. ​Penn State had 904 titles from the Lambda and Stonewall LGBTQ awards lists.​ Oregon State had 2,408 titles from 22 awards lists.​ University of Kansas expanded on that study to 6,671 titles from 57 awards lists. ​</p>

				<p>Collection diversity audits are a concrete way to understand how inequities in society, in scholarly communication, and in the publishing world impact our work in libraries. ​The quote illustrates how this work is a mindset that is practiced over time, not a one-off project with a clear end point. ​My colleagues and I developed some next steps as we completed our audit, but our implementation met with mixed results…​</p>

			      <h2>Challenges</h2>
			       <p>
				 <ul>
				   <li>Share findings with campus and colleagues <span style="color:yellow;" class="fragment">PARTIALLY DONE</span></li>
				   <li>Purchase missing titles <span style="color:yellow" class="fragment">MOSTLY DONE</span></li>
				   <li>Adjust demand driven acquisition (DDA) parameters <span style="color:green" class="fragment">DONE</span></li>
				   <li>Set goals for collecting titles by authors of color <span style="color:red" class="fragment">NOT DONE</span></li>
				 </ul>
			       </p>
			       <aside class="notes">
				 <p>We’ve presented our work as a virtual poster at ALA, and now here, but we didn’t share our findings with the campus community. Individual selectors have prioritized buying the work of authors of color, queer authors, and transgender people. We’ve adjusted our DDA parameters to “blacklist” some oligopolistic publishers. We are trying to seek out small and independent presses that publish work by people of color and buy from independent and Black owned bookstores when possible. However, we have not set any targets or done a follow up study, so we don’t know if, or how much, our purchasing demographics actually changed.</p>

			      <blockquote>"Cost saving strategies ... have largely favored vendor relationships over investing in collective effort among librarians and are part and parcel of a larger dynamic of business logic within higher education that privileges demand and immediate need over long-term support for scholarship and equity."</blockquote>
			      <p style="text-align:right;">Jahnke, Tanaka and Palazzolo 2022, p. 179</p>
			      <aside class="notes">
				<p>In the three years after this study, Armacost Library experienced significant staffing turnover and collections budget cuts. Our librarian FTE dropped from 7 to 4 and the library leader, and two of the interim leaders who replaced her, all left. Many of you in the room can share similar experiences. ​This is a problem because an environment of resource constraints encourages libraries to maximize efficiencies – relying on approval plans and vendor purchasing platforms – and to forgo the careful research needed to seek out alternatives to an inequitable publishing and purchasing ecosystem. The quote here (from an article on structural barriers to collection diversity published in last March’s College & Research Libraries) is provocative, and I think it gives us all something worth reflecting on as we try to draw lessons from these collection audits. ​</p>
