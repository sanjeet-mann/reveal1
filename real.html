			      <p>This is the online, archived version of my presentation given May 2, 2014 at the 29th NASIG Conference in Fort Worth.</p>
				  <p>Systems and e-resource librarians have been actively involved in troubleshooting access errors since the early days of electronic resources in libraries. However, all too often, the personnel with the technical expertise to fix problems are not aware of a problem until someone else (a colleague or a patron) brings it to their attention. Even a basic sense of how frequently access problems occur, or what proportion of resources are affected, can be difficult to estimate. Availability studies are a systems analysis-based research method that librarians can use to estimate the proportion of items in a library collection which are available to users or affected by systems errors. I have conducted multiple electronic resource availability studies at the University of Redlands (Mann 2012, 2013). This presentation describes modifications that I made to my basic availability study method, in order to more accurately understand why undergraduate students at the University of Redlands cannot obtain the full text of electronic resources. </p>

			  <p>There are significant differences in how librarians and students go about obtaining full text, particularly if they come across a problem. In my live presentation, I demonstrated this by comparing how I would access a problematic article with a screen capture of a student actually seeking the same article. </p>
