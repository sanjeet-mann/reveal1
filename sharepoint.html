			  <h2>Why this topic?</h2>
			  <aside class="notes">
			  <p>I chose this topic because I was curious about what is in Office 365. My goal is to inform and get us thinking about possible uses for the software, but not "sell" it as a solution.</p>
			  <p>The choice of whether or not to use technology should follow from your needs and the capabilities of the technology. For example, I use paper planner and notebooks because I found I remember things better when I physically write them down.</p>
			  <p>The best way to learn technology is to try it for something that you're already interested in, something low-stakes that you already need to do.</p>

			  <h2>Project management</h2>
			  <aside class="notes">
			  <p>Project management is structuring and sequencing work and coordinating people in order to accomplish something exceptional within constraints of limited time, money and scope.</p>
			  <p>Project management involves a mindset of being strategic to accomplish a complex goal - something "bigger" than everyday work that requires teamwork.</p>
